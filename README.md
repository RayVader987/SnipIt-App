# SnipIt-App
This Python-based application allows users to get summaries from Wikipedia or the latest news articles on any topic using either **typed** or **voice input**. It stores the summaries in a **MySQL database** and sends **SMS alerts** upon successful entries. If Wikipedia fails, it uses **Gemini AI** to generate summaries as a fallback.
